description: Bootstrap a best-practice Claude Code configuration for a new or unconfigured project. Use this skill when a user asks to set up Claude Code, initialize a project, create a CLAUDE.md, or configure permissions/hooks/settings for the first time. Also use when the user says things like "set up this project", "configure Claude Code", "bootstrap config", or "better /init". This skill replaces the built-in /init with a leaner, more opinionated setup grounded in current best practices.

# Bootstrap Claude Code Configuration

You are setting up a Claude Code configuration from scratch. The project directory may be empty or nearly empty. Your goal is to create a lean, high-quality baseline that works for any project regardless of language, framework, or tooling.

## Philosophy

Every line in CLAUDE.md costs context tokens on every single message. Frontier models follow ~150–200 instructions reliably; the system prompt already uses ~50. That leaves ~100–150 slots before quality degrades across all rules. Configuration is a multiplier on everything Claude Code does — invest in it upfront, keep it lean, let automation compound.

The single most impactful principle: give Claude a way to verify its work. If Claude has a feedback loop (tests, linters, type checkers), output quality doubles or triples.

## Step 1: Gather context

Before creating any files, understand what you're working with.

1. Check if a git repo exists. If not, do NOT create one — just note it for the user.
2. Look for existing config: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`. If any exist, tell the user this skill is for fresh setups and suggest using `/cc-config-optimize` instead.
3. Scan for clues about the project. Cover both code and content projects:
   - **Code**: `package.json`, `composer.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Makefile`, `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, any `*.sln` or `*.csproj` files.
   - **Content / static sites / docs**: `hugo.toml`, `config.toml`, `config.yaml` (Hugo), `_config.yml` (Jekyll), `astro.config.*`, `.eleventy.js`, `mkdocs.yml`, `content/`, `articles/`, `posts/`, `_posts/`, dominant `.md` files, knowledge base or style guide files (`STYLE.md`, `style-guide.md`).
   - Always check `README.md` for purpose.
   - **Design system**: `DESIGN.md` at the project root (open-source format — YAML design tokens + Markdown rationale; Claude Code and other agents read it automatically). Also check `.claude/context/design/` for Claude Design handoff artifacts (PROMPT.md, design-notes.md, screenshots/).
4. Check for existing quality tools:
   - **Code**: `.eslintrc*`, `.prettierrc*`, `phpcs.xml*`, `rustfmt.toml`, `.editorconfig`, CI configs (`.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`), pre-commit configs.
   - **Content**: `.vale.ini` / `vale.ini`, `.markdownlint.{json,yaml,yml}`, prettier configured for Markdown.
5. Check for sensitive files: `.env`, `.env.*`, `secrets/`, any `*credentials*` or `*secret*` files.

If the project directory is truly empty or has minimal content, ask the user:

- What does this project produce? (e.g. a web app, a library, articles for a tutorial site, documentation)
- What stack or toolchain is involved? (e.g. Next.js + npm, Hugo, Pandoc, plain Markdown, etc.)
- Are there inputs you'll reference repeatedly, like a shared knowledge base or style guide?

If `$ARGUMENTS` was provided, use that as the project description and infer what you can. Only ask about things you genuinely cannot determine.

Regardless of project size, also ask:

- Is there domain knowledge that should live in a shared context folder for all future skills to reference? (Examples: company profile, brand voice, buyer personas, architecture decisions, API contracts, editorial standards.) See the Domain context folder section in Step 2 — ask the user what types of company-level context they have, then name and scaffold files accordingly.

## Step 2: Create .claude/settings.json

This file provides permissions, hooks, and environment variables. It goes into version control.

Build it from these components:

### Permissions

Always include `permissions.deny` for sensitive files. Adapt the patterns to what you found in Step 1:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json",
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "Bash(curl:*)",
      "Bash(wget:*)",
      "Bash(rm -rf:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Adjust deny rules based on what you found:

- If there are credential files, add patterns for them.
- If SSH keys or cloud credentials exist nearby, add those too.

For `permissions.allow`, add entries only if you can identify concrete, safe commands from the project (e.g., `Bash(npm run test:*)`, `Bash(cargo test:*)`). If the project is too empty to know, leave `allow` out — the user will add it interactively and can persist choices via `/permissions`.

### Hooks

If you identified a formatter in Step 1, add a PostToolUse hook:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "<formatter-command> || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Common formatter commands by ecosystem:

- JS/TS: `jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs npx prettier --write`
- PHP: `jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs php-cs-fixer fix`
- Rust: `jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs rustfmt`
- Python: `jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs ruff format`
- Go: `jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs gofmt -w`
- Markdown: `jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs npx prettier --write` or `jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs markdownlint --fix`

Vale is a prose linter, not a formatter — don't wire it into PostToolUse. If you want Vale to run, suggest it as a manual command in CLAUDE.md instead.

If no formatter is detected, skip the hook — don't guess. Note it in the summary for the user to add later.

The `|| true` suffix is mandatory. Hooks must never crash Claude Code.

### Environment variables

Always include these cost-optimization defaults:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "50"
  }
}
```

This overrides auto-compaction from the default ~83% (too late for good quality) to 50%.

### Domain context folder

Context knowledge lives at three scope levels. Explain this to the user before creating anything:

**Level 1 — Company/project scope** (`.claude/context/`): Knowledge that applies to all work in this repo. Examples: company profile, brand voice, buyer personas, architecture decisions, API contracts. One file per distinct type of knowledge — name files after what they contain, not a fixed schema. Update one file, every skill that references it reflects the change.

**Level 2 — Format scope** (inside each skill's own folder): Knowledge specific to producing one output type — a whitepaper structure guide, blog length conventions, API endpoint style rules. Belongs with the skill that uses it, not in `.claude/context/`.

**Level 3 — Campaign/feature scope** (regular project subfolders): Briefings, campaign assets, or feature specs for a specific initiative. Scoped to that subfolder — not shared globally.

If the user confirmed company-level context in Step 1, ask: "What types of company-level context do you have?" Create one file per type they describe, with a `TODO` marker and a one-line description of what belongs there. Do not prescribe filenames — use names that reflect the actual content (`company-profile.md`, `brand-voice.md`, `buyer-personas.md`, `architecture-decisions.md`, or whatever fits the project).

Also create `.claude/context/README.md` as a brief index explaining the convention:

```markdown
# Context

Company-scoped knowledge referenced by skills and CLAUDE.md files across this repo.
One file per type of knowledge — update once, every reference reflects the change.

Format-specific guidelines live inside each skill's own folder, not here.
Campaign or feature briefings live in their respective project subfolders, not here.
```

Wire each context file into CLAUDE.md's References section in Step 3 using progressive disclosure triggers.

**Hierarchical CLAUDE.md for multi-level projects:** If the project has a nested folder structure — a marketing monorepo with campaign subfolders, a multi-package code repo, a website with distinct content sections — suggest CLAUDE.md files at each meaningful directory level:

- Root `CLAUDE.md` → @-imports all company-wide context files from `.claude/context/`
- Each subfolder's `CLAUDE.md` → @-imports briefings or specs scoped to that folder

When Claude Code starts in any subfolder, it reads CLAUDE.md files up the directory tree, so a session in `campaigns/product-xy/june-2026/` automatically gets company context (via root CLAUDE.md) plus campaign context (via the local CLAUDE.md). Skills invoked in that session inherit all of it without hard-coded absolute paths to shared files. Guide the user to create and maintain CLAUDE.md files at each level where the context meaningfully changes as the project structure grows.

**Claude Design handoffs:** If the project uses Claude Design (Anthropic's visual design tool), direct the user to place Claude Design handoff artifacts (PROMPT.md, design-notes.md, screenshots/) in `.claude/context/design/` — not the project root. This keeps handoff snapshots versioned alongside the codebase without cluttering the root. `DESIGN.md` is different: it is a persistent, project-wide design system spec (YAML tokens + Markdown rationale) that lives at the project root and is auto-read by Claude Code and other agents. If `DESIGN.md` already exists or is being added, wire it into CLAUDE.md with `@DESIGN.md **Read when:** building or editing any UI component` — do not copy its contents into `.claude/context/`.

## Step 3: Create CLAUDE.md

Build a project-level CLAUDE.md. Target 20–40 lines for a fresh project. It will grow as the project grows.

Structure:

```markdown
# <Project Name>

<One-line description. Stack or toolchain summary — works for code (e.g. "Next.js + Prisma") or content (e.g. "Hugo site, articles in Markdown, edited with Vale").>

## Commands

<List exact commands the project uses. Examples:

- Code projects: `npm test`, `cargo build`, `pytest tests/`
- Content/static-site projects: `hugo build`, `vale .`, `markdownlint **/*.md`, `pandoc input.md -o output.pdf`
  If unknown yet, add placeholders with TODO markers.>

## Structure

<Only if you can already identify a meaningful directory layout. Otherwise omit. For content projects, mention things like the article output directory or where the knowledge base lives.>

## References

<Optional. For content projects with a shared knowledge base or style guide, and for any project where a .claude/context/ folder was set up in Step 2, use progressive disclosure rather than inlining content:
```

@knowledge-base/index.md
@style-guide.md **Read when:** writing or editing articles
@DESIGN.md **Read when:** building or editing any UI component

```
Only include this section if such files exist.>

## Conventions

<Only concrete rules that deviate from defaults or that Claude commonly gets wrong. For content projects this might be voice/tone, terminology, or output format requirements. For code projects, conventions that aren't enforced by the linter. If the project is too new, keep this minimal or omit.>

## Don't

<Explicit prohibitions. Always include at minimum:>
- Don't commit secrets or credentials to git
- Don't use --force flags — fix the underlying issue instead

## Learnings

When the user corrects a mistake or points out a recurring issue, append a one-line
summary to .claude/learnings.md. Don't modify CLAUDE.md directly.

## Compact Instructions

When compacting, preserve: list of modified files, current test status, open TODOs, and key decisions made.
```

Rules for writing CLAUDE.md:

- Never include standard language conventions Claude already knows.
- Never include rules that the linter/formatter enforces — "never send an LLM to do a linter's job."
- Never include personality instructions ("be a senior engineer").
- Never include file-by-file codebase descriptions.
- Use `IMPORTANT:` or `YOU MUST` sparingly — if everything is important, nothing is.
- Prefer concrete commands over vague advice ("run `npm test -- auth.test.ts`" beats "run the relevant tests").

## Step 4: Create AGENTS.md (if multi-tool environment)

Only create this if you have evidence that other AI coding tools are used (e.g., `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.github/copilot/`, cursor-related configs, or the user mentions it).

AGENTS.md is the vendor-neutral standard read by Codex, Amp, Cursor, Copilot, and others. It demonstrably reduces runtime (~29%) and output token consumption (~17%).

If created, keep it focused on universal concerns: setup commands, architecture boundaries, code style rules, testing conventions, and safety rules. Then reference it from CLAUDE.md via `@AGENTS.md`.

## Step 5: Update .gitignore and create .claudeignore

### 5a: Update .gitignore

Append these lines if they're not already present:

```
# Claude Code — personal files
.claude/settings.local.json
.claude/local.md
```

### 5b: Create .claudeignore (if the repo has large unreadable directories)

`.claudeignore` follows `.gitignore` syntax and tells Claude Code which paths to skip entirely when indexing the project. Every excluded directory reduces the invisible token overhead that accumulates before the user types anything.

Create `.claudeignore` if you detected any of the following in Step 1:

- Build output: `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `out/`, `target/`, `_site/`
- Dependency trees: `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `.venv/`, `venv/`
- Test coverage reports: `coverage/`, `.nyc_output/`
- Large binary or media asset folders: anything with predominantly images, videos, or binaries

Example for a typical JS/TS project:

```
node_modules/
dist/
.next/
coverage/
```

Adapt to what you actually found — don't create the file if the repo is small and tidy, and don't add entries speculatively. If the project is too empty to judge, note it in the Step 7 summary as something to add once the repo grows.

Add `.claudeignore` to the Key Config Files table in Step 6 if created.

## Step 6: Create Key Config Files table auto-sync

Add a "Key Config Files" table to CLAUDE.md and a pre-commit hook that keeps it in sync with the filesystem. This gives Claude instant orientation on every message without manual maintenance.

### 6a: Add the table to CLAUDE.md

After the project description line, add a `## Key Config Files` section with a Markdown table listing every config file you created in the previous steps. Use this format:

```markdown
## Key Config Files

| File                    | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `CLAUDE.md`             | Project instructions, loaded every message |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Permissions, hooks, environment variables  |
| `.gitignore`            | Git ignore patterns                        |
```

Include only files that actually exist and are tracked by git (not gitignored). Write a concise, specific purpose for each.

### 6b: Create the sync script

Create `scripts/sync-config-table.sh` — a bash script that automatically keeps the table in sync:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Keeps the "Key Config Files" table in CLAUDE.md in sync with the filesystem.
# - Removes rows for files that no longer exist
# - Appends rows for new config files with a placeholder description
# - Excludes gitignored files (they are per-machine, not part of the committed state)
# Preserves all existing hand-written descriptions.
# Invoked automatically by the pre-commit hook.

  # Auto-stage so the updated table is included in the triggering commit
  git add CLAUDE.md
fi
```

Make the script executable: `chmod +x scripts/sync-config-table.sh`

### 6c: Create the pre-commit hook

Create `.githooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Keep CLAUDE.md config file table in sync
bash scripts/sync-config-table.sh
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit`

### 6d: Activate the hooks directory

Run this command to tell git to use `.githooks/` instead of the default `.git/hooks/`:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This needs to be run once per clone. Note this in the summary (Step 7) so the user is aware.

**Important:** If the project already uses Husky or another hook manager, skip this entire step and note it in the summary. The sync script would conflict with existing hook infrastructure.

## Step 7: Present summary

After creating all files, give the user a concise summary:

1. List every file created with a one-line description — including any `.claude/context/` files if they were scaffolded.
2. Note any TODO placeholders that need filling in once the project takes shape.
3. Mention what was intentionally left out and why (e.g., "No PostToolUse hook yet because no formatter was detected — add one once you pick a formatter.").
4. Remind the user of five high-leverage next steps:
   - Run `/context` in a fresh session immediately after setup to check startup token overhead. If it exceeds ~10,000 tokens before sending a single message, something is loading too much — oversized CLAUDE.md, too many unconditional context imports, or a large number of MCP tools are common causes.
   - Add test/build/lint commands to CLAUDE.md once they exist.
   - Run `/cc-config-optimize` after the project has some code to get a project-aware configuration pass.
   - Consider adding MCP servers to `.mcp.json` as needs arise (Context7 for docs, GitHub for PRs, etc.).
   - Once recurring multi-step workflows emerge, the `/schedule` skill can automate them — run a chain of skills on a cron schedule and land the output in a review folder for human sign-off before anything goes live.
5. If the Key Config Files auto-sync was set up (Step 6), remind the user:
   - The pre-commit hook requires a one-time activation per clone: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
   - This command was already run for the current clone, but collaborators or fresh clones need to run it too.
   - Suggest documenting it in the project README's setup instructions.
6. Explain the Learnings mechanism:
   - When the user corrects a mistake, Claude appends a one-line summary to `.claude/learnings.md` instead of modifying CLAUDE.md directly.
   - This file grows uncurated over time. Running `/cc-config-optimize` reviews it and proposes promoting recurring patterns into CLAUDE.md or skills, and deleting one-off entries.
7. Suggest committing the new config files to git.

## What NOT to do

- Don't run `/init`. This skill replaces it.
- Don't create MCP configs. MCP choices are project-specific and premature for an empty project.
- Don't create skills. Skills encode recurring workflows that don't exist yet.
- Don't create `.claude/local.md` or `settings.local.json`. Those are personal and should be created by the user.
- Don't over-engineer. A 20-line CLAUDE.md that's accurate beats an 80-line one full of guesses.
- Don't include information you're not confident about. TODOs are better than wrong instructions.

## Feedback

Before ending the session, ask: "Did this configuration meet your expectations? If anything needs adjusting, I'll log it to `.claude/learnings.md`."
