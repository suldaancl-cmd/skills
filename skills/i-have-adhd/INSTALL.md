# Install i-have-adhd

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

### Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ayghri/i-have-adhd
claude plugin install i-have-adhd@i-have-adhd
```

Type `/i-have-adhd`.

### Verify

```bash
claude plugin list
```

### Update

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update i-have-adhd
```

### Uninstall

```bash
claude plugin uninstall i-have-adhd
claude plugin marketplace remove i-have-adhd
```

Or keep it installed and turn it off: `claude plugin disable i-have-adhd`.

### Always-on (optional)

A `SessionStart` hook loads the full ruleset at the start of every session, no `/i-have-adhd` needed:

```bash
touch ~/.claude/.i-have-adhd-always
```

Back to on-demand:

```bash
rm ~/.claude/.i-have-adhd-always
```

The hook only fires when the flag file exists, so installing the plugin changes nothing by itself. Honors `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if you've moved your config dir. "stop adhd mode" still turns it off for the current session.

<summary><strong>Zed</strong></summary>

Zed's Agent reads Agent Skills natively: the same `SKILL.md`, no conversion. (Zed's older "Rules" were replaced by Skills plus `AGENTS.md` instructions.)

### Install

In the Agent Panel, open the Skills manager and choose **Create skill from URL** (also in the command palette as `agent: create skill from url`), then paste:

```
https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd/blob/main/skills/i-have-adhd/SKILL.md
```

Save it in **User** scope for every project, or **Project** scope for one. Then type `/i-have-adhd` in the Agent Panel.

Prefer the filesystem? Clone the repo and drop the skill folder into your user skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd
cp -R i-have-adhd/skills/i-have-adhd ~/.config/zed/skills/
```

### Verify

Open the Skills manager in the Agent Panel and confirm `i-have-adhd` is listed. Or type `/` and confirm it appears.

### Update

Re-import from the same URL (overwrites), or re-copy the folder after `git pull`.

### Uninstall

Remove `i-have-adhd` from the Skills manager, or delete `~/.config/zed/skills/i-have-adhd`.

### Always-on (optional)

Add to your personal `~/.config/zed/AGENTS.md`:

<summary><strong>Hermes</strong></summary>

### Install

```bash
hermes skills install ayghri/i-have-adhd/skills/i-have-adhd
```

Type `/i-have-adhd`. The skill installs into `~/.hermes/skills/` and is exposed as a slash command at the next session start.

Prefer to browse first? Add this repo as a skill source (a "tap"), then search and install:

```bash
hermes skills tap add ayghri/i-have-adhd
hermes skills search adhd
hermes skills install ayghri/i-have-adhd/skills/i-have-adhd
```

### Verify

```bash
hermes skills list
```

### Update

```bash
hermes skills update i-have-adhd
```

### Uninstall

```bash
hermes skills uninstall i-have-adhd
```

Or remove the tap too: `hermes skills tap remove ayghri/i-have-adhd`.

### Always-on (optional)

Add to the `AGENTS.md` in your working directory (Hermes loads it per workdir), or to your persona `SOUL.md` for every session:

<summary><strong>Pi</strong></summary>

Pi implements the Agent Skills standard, so the same `SKILL.md` loads directly, no conversion. Pi's invocation differs from the others: skills are called as `/skill:<name>`.

### Install

```bash
npx skills add ayghri/i-have-adhd -a pi -y
```

Prefer the filesystem? Pi discovers skills in `~/.pi/agent/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/` (global), and `.pi/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` (project):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/skills
cp -R i-have-adhd/skills/i-have-adhd ~/.pi/agent/skills/
```

Enable skill slash commands in Pi's `settings.json`:

```json
{ "enableSkillCommands": true }
```

Start a new session and type `/skill:i-have-adhd`.

### Verify

```bash
npx skills list
```

Or type `/skill:` in a session and confirm `i-have-adhd` is listed.

### Update

```bash
npx skills update i-have-adhd
```

Or re-copy the folder after `git pull`.

### Uninstall

```bash
npx skills remove i-have-adhd
```

Or delete `~/.pi/agent/skills/i-have-adhd`.

### Always-on (optional)

Add to your project `AGENTS.md`:

<summary><strong>Gemini CLI</strong></summary>

Gemini CLI has no plugin marketplace, so there are two native routes: a **custom command** (opt-in, off until you invoke it) or an **extension** (always-on once installed). The command route matches this skill's default posture; pick it unless you want the rules on every session.

### Install (command, opt-in)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/commands
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd/main/skills/i-have-adhd/agents/gemini.toml \
  -o ~/.gemini/commands/i-have-adhd.toml
```

Start a new session, type `/i-have-adhd`. It stays on for that session.

### Install (extension, always-on)

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd
```

The extension loads `GEMINI.md`, which imports the full skill, so the rules apply from message one. `git` must be installed.

### Verify

```bash
gemini extensions list          # extension route
ls ~/.gemini/commands           # command route: i-have-adhd.toml present
```

Or type `/` in a session and confirm `i-have-adhd` is listed.

### Update

```bash
gemini extensions update i-have-adhd    # extension route
# command route: re-run the curl above
```

### Uninstall

```bash
gemini extensions uninstall i-have-adhd    # extension route
rm ~/.gemini/commands/i-have-adhd.toml     # command route
```

<summary><strong>GitHub Copilot (VS Code and Copilot CLI)</strong></summary>

Copilot reads Agent Skills natively: the same `SKILL.md`, no conversion. It scans `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/` in the project, and `~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, and `~/.agents/skills/` globally.

### Install

```bash
npx skills add ayghri/i-have-adhd -a github-copilot        # this project
npx skills add ayghri/i-have-adhd -a github-copilot -g     # all projects
```

Without the CLI, copy the skill folder into any directory Copilot scans:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/skills
cp -R i-have-adhd/skills/i-have-adhd ~/.copilot/skills/
```

### Verify

Type `/` in the chat input and confirm `i-have-adhd` appears. Or:

```bash
npx skills list
npx skills ls -g    # if installed globally
```

### Update

```bash
npx skills update i-have-adhd
```

Or re-copy the folder after `git pull`.

### Uninstall

```bash
npx skills remove i-have-adhd
```

Or delete the `i-have-adhd` folder from the skills directory it landed in.

### Activation note

Copilot respects `disable-model-invocation`: nothing applies until you invoke the skill, same as Claude Code (tested in [#60](https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd/pull/60)).

### Always-on (optional)

Add the block below to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in the project (Copilot reads it into every chat):

<summary><strong>Cursor, OpenCode, Amp, and any other agent-skills harness</strong></summary>

Works with any harness that reads agent skills. Swap `-a <agent>` for yours.

### Install

```bash
npx skills add ayghri/i-have-adhd                  # this workspace
npx skills add ayghri/i-have-adhd -g               # all projects
npx skills add ayghri/i-have-adhd -a cursor -y     # one agent only
npx skills add ayghri/i-have-adhd -a opencode -y
```

New agent chat, type `/i-have-adhd`.

Without the CLI, copy the skill folder into whatever path your agent scans:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/skills     # Cursor. Use .agents/skills for OpenCode, or your agent's own path
cp -R i-have-adhd/skills/i-have-adhd ~/.cursor/skills/
```

### Verify

```bash
npx skills list
npx skills ls -g    # if installed globally
```

### Update

```bash
npx skills update i-have-adhd
npx skills update -g    # if installed globally
```

### Uninstall

```bash
npx skills remove i-have-adhd
npx skills remove i-have-adhd -g    # if installed globally
```

### Always-on (optional)

Paste this into your agent's persistent rules file. Cursor: **Settings → Rules → User Rules**, or a project rule under `.cursor/rules/` with `alwaysApply: true`. OpenCode: `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`.

## How activation works

1. **Installed, not invoked.** In Claude Code, nothing happens: `SKILL.md` sets `disable-model-invocation: true`, so the model never sees the skill and never applies the rules on its own. That flag is Claude Code's own; Codex ships with implicit invocation allowed (see the README), and harnesses that implement the open Agent Skills spec load every skill's description at startup and may activate the skill themselves.
2. **You type `/i-have-adhd`.** Rules on for that session. "stop adhd mode" or "normal mode" turns them off.
3. **You touch `~/.claude/.i-have-adhd-always`** (Claude Code). A `SessionStart` hook loads the full ruleset from message one, every session.
4. **You add the always-on snippet above** (other harnesses). Keeps the core rules in your agent's persistent context.

In Claude Code, no middle ground: if you did not turn it on, it is off.

## Troubleshooting

**`/i-have-adhd` not in autocomplete.** Restart the agent. The plugin index is read at startup.

**Always-on flag has no effect.** Update the plugin (`claude plugin marketplace update i-have-adhd`) and restart. Hooks are read at startup, and the flag needs the plugin version that ships `hooks/hooks.json`.

**`claude plugin marketplace add` fails.** Use the `owner/repo` form. A local path must point at the repo root, not `.claude-plugin/`.

**Installed but replies still preamble.** Open a new session. If it still drifts, tighten the wording in `skills/i-have-adhd/SKILL.md`.

**Want different rules.** Fork, edit `skills/i-have-adhd/SKILL.md`, then swap your copy in:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall i-have-adhd            # drop the upstream copy first:
claude plugin marketplace remove i-have-adhd   # fork and upstream share both names
claude plugin marketplace add <your-username>/i-have-adhd
claude plugin install i-have-adhd@i-have-adhd
```

Restart, then re-invoke `/i-have-adhd`.

**Skill missing after `npx skills add`.** Start a new agent chat. Skills are indexed at session start. Confirm the folder landed where your agent scans (`~/.cursor/skills/` for Cursor, `.agents/skills/` for OpenCode) and that the frontmatter `name` matches the folder name.
